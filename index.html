            <h2>Curiosities About Adoption</h2>
            <ul class="curiosity-list">
                <li>Adopting a cat from a shelter can save two lives: the cat you adopt and the cat that takes its place
                    in the shelter.</li>
                <li>Many shelter cats are already trained and have known temperaments, making it easier to find a cat
                    that fits well with your lifestyle.</li>
                <li>Adopting a cat often comes with initial veterinary care, such as vaccinations and spaying/neutering,
                    reducing the initial costs for new pet owners.</li>
                <li>Black cats are often overlooked in shelters due to superstitions and myths. Adopting a black cat can
                    save a life and break these misconceptions.</li>
                <li>Senior cats are less likely to be adopted but can make wonderful companions. They are often more
                    mellow and already have established personalities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these curiosities can help more people choose adoption and provide loving homes for cats in
                need.</p>

            <h2 class="top3-main-heading">Top 3 Reasons to Adopt a Cat</h2>
            <p>Here are the top three reasons to consider adopting a cat:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Save a Life</h3>
                    <p>By adopting a cat, you are giving a homeless animal a second chance at life. Shelters are often
                        overcrowded, and adopting helps reduce the number of cats in need of homes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Find a Loyal Companion</h3>
                    <p>Adopted cats often show immense gratitude and form strong bonds with their new families. They can
                        be incredibly loyal and loving companions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Support Ethical Pet Ownership</h3>
                    <p>Adopting a cat supports ethical pet ownership by reducing the demand for breeding mills, which
                        often have poor conditions. It also helps combat the issue of pet overpopulation.</p>

            <p>Here are some ways you can help cats find their forever homes:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Find a Street Cat</h3>
                    <p>Street cats often need a loving home. You can rescue and provide care for a stray cat that you
                        find in your neighborhood.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Adoption</h3>
                    <p>Adopting a cat from a shelter or rescue organization is a wonderful way to give a cat a second
                        chance at a happy life. Shelters often have cats of all ages and personalities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Foster a Cat</h3>
                    <p>Fostering a cat provides a temporary home until they find their forever family. It's a great way
                        to help cats in need while enjoying the companionship of a cat.</p>
